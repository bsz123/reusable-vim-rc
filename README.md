# What is this?

This repo is for me (Ben Zuke) to have a backup of my vim config(s). The reason for the plural is different editors have different *.rcs* that can be independently or need to be configured separately.

## What do I get from this?

The key highlights of this repo are:
- vim rcs for jetbrains and visual studio code + its forks
- plugin loading for vim (at a system level)

## What idiot decided to make this a flat repo?

I did.

## What could be improved?

In the future having a script that can install editor dependent rcs and plugins depending on if an editor exists is a nice to have
